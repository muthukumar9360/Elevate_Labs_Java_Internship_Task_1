# ðŸ§® Java Console Calculator

## ðŸ“Œ Description
This is a simple **console-based calculator** built using **Java**.  
It demonstrates the use of:
- Methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- `Scanner` class for user input.
- Loops to allow multiple calculations until the user exits.
- Conditionals (`if`, `switch`) for logic flow.

This task was given as part of my **Java Developer Internship**.
